# Authoring Content in Markdown

Cecil supports [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) syntax in `.md` files as well as [front matter](https://cecil.app/documentation/content/#front-matter) to define variables.

## Inline style

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

```markdown

```markdown

You can highlight `inline code` with backticks.

## How to structure page

Cecil automatically use the page file name as title, but you can also define title and other variables in the [front matter](https://cecil.app/documentation/content/#front-matter).

You can structure content using a heading. Headings in Markdown are indicated by a number of `#` at the start of the line.

```markdown
---
title: Page title
description: Page short description.
---

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

## Heading

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
```

## Image

Images use Cecilâ€™s built-in optimized asset support.

![Cecil favicon](/favicon.png "Cecil favicon")

```markdown
![Cecil favicon](/favicon.png "Cecil favicon")
```

Cecil search images in `assets/` and `static/` folders, but relative path is also supported:

```markdown
![Cecil favicon](../assets/favicon.png "Cecil favicon")
```

## Code block

A code block is indicated by a block with three backticks ` ``` ` at the start and end. You can indicate the programming language being used after the opening backticks.

```php
echo "Hello world";
```

<pre>
```php
echo "Hello world";
```
</pre>
