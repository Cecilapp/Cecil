# Content

Content is a bunch of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files (or plain text files), called _Pages_, organized in folders.
Folders in the root are called _Section_ (ie: "Blog", "Project", etc.).

## Pages

A _Page_ can contain a front matter and/or a body.

### Front matter

Any file that contains a front matter will be processed to extract some variables. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must be a valid [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Preview).

**Predefined variables**

| Variable      | Description   | Default value                     |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| title         | Title         | File basename (without extension) |
| section       | Section       | Root directory of the file path   |
| layout        | Layout        | See _Layout fallback logic_       |
| date          | Date          | File modification datetime        |
| menu          | Menu          | Homepage and Sections             |
| tags          | Tags          | _Empty_                           |
| categories    | Categories    | _Empty_                           |
| permalink     | Permalink     | Page pathname (ie: "blog/post-1") |

### Body

Body is the main content of the page, it could be written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or in plain text.

### Example

```yml
---
title: "The title"
date: 2013-01-01
customvar: "Value of customvar"
---
_Markdown_ page content.
```
