## Publish

By default, the static website is built in the `_site` directory and can be published as is.

### Example

```text
<mywebsite>/_site
├─ blog
|  ├─ post-1
|  |  └─ index.html
|  ├─ post-2
|  |  └─ index.html
|  └─ index.html
├─ project
|  ├─ project-1
|  |  └─ index.html
|  └─ index.html
├─ about
|  └─ index.hml
├─ index.html
└─ robots.txt
```
