# Quick Start

[![Import this project into Forestry](https://assets.forestry.io/import-to-forestryK.svg)](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=cecilapp/starter-blog) [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/Cecilapp/starter-blog) [![Deploy with ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/button)](https://zeit.co/new/project?template=https://github.com/Cecilapp/starter-blog)

> Create a website with the default skeleton.

## Step 1: Install

Download `cecil.phar` from your terminal:
```bash
curl -LO https://cecil.app/cecil.phar
```

You can also [download Cecil](https://cecil.app/download/) manually from the website.

> [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) 7.1+ is required.

## Step 2: Create a new website

```bash
php cecil.phar newsite <mywebsite>
```

## Step 3: Add content

```bash
php cecil.phar new blog/my-first-post.md
```

Now you can edit the newly created content file if you want: `<mywebsite>/content/blog/my-first-post.md`.

## Step 4: Serve the website

To build and serve the website, just run the following command from the root of your project:

```bash
php cecil.phar serve --drafts
```

>- `serve` command run a local HTTP server and a watcher: if a file (a page, a template or the config) is modified, the browser current page is reloaded.
>- `--drafts` option is used to include drafts.
