# Quick Start

> You can create a [starter blog](https://github.com/Cecilapp/the-butler) with [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) (a static CMS)...

[![Import this project into Forestry](https://assets.forestry.io/import-to-forestryK.svg)](https://cecil.app/cms/forestry/import/)

> ... or create a new website with the default skeleton in 4 steps

## Step 1: Install Cecil

Download `cecil.phar` from your terminal:

```bash
curl -LO https://cecil.app/cecil.phar
```

You can also [download Cecil](https://cecil.app/download/) manually from the website.

> [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) 7.1+ is required.

## Step 2: Create a new website

```bash
php cecil.phar new:site <mywebsite>
```

## Step 3: Add some content

```bash
php cecil.phar new:page blog/my-first-post.md
```

Now you can edit the newly created page with your favorite [Markdown editor](https://www.typora.io): `<mywebsite>/content/blog/my-first-post.md`.

## Step 4: Start the server

Run the following command in `<mywebsite>` to build and serve the website:

```bash
php cecil.phar serve --drafts
```

Navigate to your new website at http://localhost:8000/.

>- `serve` command run a local HTTP server and a watcher: if a file (a page, a template or the config) is modified, the browser's current page is reloaded.
>- `--drafts` option is used to include drafts.
