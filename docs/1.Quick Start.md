# Quick Start

Create a Cecil website with the default skeleton.

## Step 1: Install

Download `cecil.phar` from your terminal:
```bash
curl -SOL https://cecil.app/cecil.phar
```

You can also [download](https://cecil.app/download/) it manually from the website.

> Note: [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) 7.1+ is required.

## Step 2: Create a new website

```bash
php cecil.phar newsite <mywebsite>
```

## Step 3: Add content

```bash
php cecil.phar new blog/my-first-post.md
```

Now you can edit the newly created content file if you want: `<mywebsite>/content/blog/my-first-post.md`.

## Step 4: Serve the website

To build and serve the website, just run the following command from the root of your project:

```bash
php cecil.phar serve -d
```

> `serve` command run a local HTTP server and a watcher: if a file (page, layout or config) is modified, the browser current page is reloaded.
>
> `-d`option is used to include drafts.
