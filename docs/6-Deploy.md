# Deploy

By default your static site is built in the `_site` directory, and can be deployed as is.

Below are some recipes to automate build and/or deployment of a static site.

## Jamstack platforms

### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

> A powerful serverless platform with an intuitive git-based workflow. Automated deployments, shareable previews, and much more.

_netlify.toml_:

```bash
[build]
  publish = "_site"
  command = "curl -sSOL https://cecil.app/build.sh && bash ./build.sh"

[build.environment]
  PHP_VERSION = "7.4"

[context.production.environment]
  CECIL_ENV = "production"

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  CECIL_ENV = "preview"
```

[Official documentation](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/)
